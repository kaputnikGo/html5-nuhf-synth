# html5-nuhf-synth
Parameterised NUHF audio transmitter synth using HTML 5 and javascript.

Code designed to utilise HTML 5 web audio oscillator to play inaudible NUHF frequencies for an upcoming live stream over Twitch.

basically throughout the track an inaudible synth is playing tones of near ultra high frequencies (over 18kHz) where a particular frequency 
represents a letter of the alphabet. Quotes from Australia's Privacy Act of 1988 are converted to these inaudible alphabetic frequency 
representations and played alongside the audible musical parts of the track. The process used here is taken from real-world examples of 
cross-device tracking developed by tech companies where these inaudible tones are embedded in adverts in a coded format designed to be 
"heard" by certain apps installed on mobile phones that inform those companies that the advert is being watched and by who. Marketing
materials from these companies say that this technology can be found in shop beacons, advertising billboards, during adverts on television, 
video streaming and music streaming services.


Just a repository at this time. Code is functional but html/css display is within specific contexts not present here. Some JS includes (JQuery) are local 
and not included in this repo presently.
